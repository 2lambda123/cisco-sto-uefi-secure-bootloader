###### What organization or people are asking to have this signed:
Cisco Sytems
IANA Enterprise Number 9

###### Version of shim:
https://github.com/rhboot/shim/releases/tag/14

###### Sysdev Submission ID:
UEFI File Submission ID: 14584127439109655

###### What product or service is this for:
Cisco Appliances and Virtual products that are using Linux based Opererating Systems

###### What's the justification that this really does need to be signed for the whole world to be able to boot it:
Customers using Cisco Virtual products that run on 3rd party servers (DELL, HP...) do not have permissions to 
change the UEFI db and add our keys.  The Microsoft signed SHIM allows these products to securely run on those 
platforms.
